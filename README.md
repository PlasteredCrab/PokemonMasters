Blender 2.8 import script for LMD files from Pokemon Masters

Just place it in your Blender install's AddOn folder and enable it in the preferences.

Update 3/4/20:

  Rewrote a bulk of the script for 2.8 and to include new research.
  
  Will now load vertex normals.
  
  Auto loads textures if they are png and in the right directory.
  
  Detects the type of lmd so no more version selection.
